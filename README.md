# assert-density-coverage-plugin
Coverage.py reports the lines that were executed. This is an experimental project to make coverage also report the number of asserts executed while running those lines.

I investigated coverage.py and it doesn't seem obvious how one could integrate with it. I created an issue on the coverage.py repo, so that maybe I get a hint of how this could be done
